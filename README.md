# What is Terraform?
Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources safely and efficiently


Difference between terraform and ansible
Terraform provides a mechanism to manage the status of infrastructure resources and handles the whole lifecycle of those resources, from creation to deletion. Ansible focuses on configuring and maintaining already-existing systems rather than managing the entire lifecycle.
